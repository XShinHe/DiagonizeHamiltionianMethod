# DiagonizeHamiltionianMethod    
## introduction  
The first year course work of Mathematics in Chemistry, team with P.B. Song & Y. Song.  (@2016)
  
Now should point the infinite potential well basis, actually can relate to DVR method (implement in fortran and python3 respectively), see (basic DVR)[https://github.com/XShinHe/DVR]. 
  
this procedure written in **MATLAB**, and test in **LINUX** platform.   

## what to do  
- [  ] we use eigenstate of infinite well to obtain a nobad result, how about using eigenstate of oscillator? If there is an 
advantage ? Answar: no advantages.
