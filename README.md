# DiagonizeHamiltionianMethod    
## introduction  
The first year course work of Mathematics in Chemistry (Prof. Liu), I team work with P.B. Song & Y. Song.  
Here revised to save here, and now have fixed with path bugs.  

the procedure written in **MATLAB**, and test in **LINUX** platform.  

## what to do  
- [  ] determine the convergence condition of width of infinite well, and size of Hilbert space  
- [  ] we use eigenstate of infinite well to obtain a nobad result, how about using eigenstate of oscillator? If there is an 
advantage ?
